Our group wrote getter and setter methods, started the constructor for GameState, and started on the getChildren() function.

Mike implemented the sorting method in MinimaxAlphaBeta and the alphaBetaSearch function in MinimaxAlphaBeta 

Aimee almost finished getChildren. She just needs to figure out the GameStateChild constructor.

Samuel made some very simple additions to the getUtility function. Makes it so that the utility will increment based on the amount of deadArchers, archers with lowHealth, and if there are no archers remaining

Mike finished the gamestate child? It there's still a few bugs

Samuel finished the getUtility

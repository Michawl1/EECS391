Aimee implemented the open list as adressed in slide 23 in lecture 3 notes

Mike implemented the heuristic, and Aimee deleted it because she found it in the API
Mike implemented getter methods to flesh out the MapLocation on Aimee's computer as he was explaining it to her

Aimee implemented a search method within the while loop, she has not figured out how to implement the heuristic yet.

Samuel implemented the shouldReplanPath method; basic check to see if the enemy footman is in the path 

Mike implemented the heuristic again, better this time, and added it to the neighbor costs

Aimee finished AstarSearch and now it compiles

Aimee fixed a few more things in AstarSearch

Michael rewrote the entire algorithm now works and remaps

Samuel implemented kill for footman if it doesn't reach the goal; added commenting to functions

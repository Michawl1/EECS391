I have modified "FirstAgent.java" (the resource gathering agent) to create more units

FirstAgent will create 3 peasants and then 3 farms.

Then the peasants will construct a barracks and then the barracks will make a footman

The peasants will also make a blacksmith (I tried making a knight but it wouldn't create it for some reason).
	The knight creation code was removed and replaced with the footman
